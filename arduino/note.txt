1. Network Setup

All devices (Arduino, server, and app) should be connected to the same WiFi network (your home/office router, or a dedicated hotspot).
The “server IP” is the local IP address of the computer running your Node.js server (e.g., 192.168.1.100). You can find this by running ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux/Mac) on the server machine.
2. Communication Flow

Arduino connects to the same WiFi and sends HTTP POST requests to the server’s IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:3000/api/data).
Server (Node.js) receives the data, saves it to MongoDB Atlas, and provides REST endpoints for both Arduino and the app.
App (React Native/web) also connects to the same server IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:3000/api/data) to fetch or send data.
3. If All Are on the Same Machine

You can use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the server IP for testing on that machine.
For Arduino or other devices on the same network, use the actual local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100), not localhost.
4. Which WiFi?

Any WiFi network that all devices can join. They must be on the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.x).
If you use a mobile hotspot, connect all devices to that hotspot.
5. Which Server IP?

The IP address of the computer running the Node.js server.
Example: If your server computer’s IP is 192.168.1.100, then Arduino and the app should use http://192.168.1.100:3000 as the base URL.
Summary Table:

Device	Network Connection	Server Address to Use
Server	WiFi/Ethernet	localhost or 127.0.0.1 (self)
Arduino	Same WiFi	192.168.1.100 (server’s IP)
App	Same WiFi	192.168.1.100 (server’s IP)
Key Points:

All devices must be on the same network for local development.
Use the server’s local IP for all network requests from Arduino and the app.
If you deploy to the cloud, use your public IP or domain.
